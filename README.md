# Arduino Project Documentation

## Introduction
This document provides instructions for setting up and running an Arduino project.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- Arduino board
- Arduino IDE installed on your computer
- USB cable to connect the Arduino board to your computer

## Setup
Follow these steps to set up your Arduino project:

1. Connect the Arduino board to your computer using the USB cable.
2. Open the Arduino IDE.
3. Select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
4. Open the `main.cpp` file in the Arduino IDE.

## Uploading the Code
To upload the code to your Arduino board, follow these steps:

1. Verify that the code in `main.cpp` is correct and complete.
2. Click on the "Upload" button in the Arduino IDE.
3. Wait for the code to compile and upload to the Arduino board.
4. Once the upload is complete, the Arduino board is ready to run the code.

## Running the Arduino Project
To run the Arduino project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure the Arduino board is connected to your computer.
2. Power on the Arduino board.
3. The code will start running automatically.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the setup or execution of the Arduino project, try the following:

- Double-check the connections between the Arduino board and your computer.
- Ensure that the correct board and port are selected in the Arduino IDE.
- Verify that the code in `main.cpp` is error-free and compatible with your Arduino board.

## Conclusion
This document has provided instructions for setting up and running an Arduino project. If you have any further questions or need assistance, please refer to the official Arduino documentation or seek help from the Arduino community.
